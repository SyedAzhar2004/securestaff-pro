# SecureStaff - Spring Boot MVC CRUD Application

This is a Spring Boot application for managing employees. It supports **Employee**, **Manager**, and **Admin** roles, with role-based access control (RBAC). You can run it with an in-memory **H2** database for simplicity or configure it to use your local **MySQL** database for real-world scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security (Authentication & Authorization)
- Spring Data JPA (For interfacing with database)
- Thymeleaf (For UI rendering)
- H2 Database (For in-memory storage)
- MySQL (For local database)

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Setup**

### 1. **H2 (In-Memory Database)**

By default, this project is set up to use the **H2 database**. It will store data in memory and does not require any external setup. The application will automatically create the necessary tables when started.

To use **H2**:
- Simply run the application, and H2 will handle everything.
- You can access the H2 console via:  
  `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`  
  (Login with `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` and username/password as `sa`).

### 2. **MySQL (Local Database)**

If you want to use a **MySQL** database, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have **MySQL** installed and running locally.
2. Create a database called `your_db` (or any name you prefer) in MySQL.
3. Update `src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties` with your MySQL credentials.

Example configuration:
```properties
# src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.profiles.active=mysql
```
